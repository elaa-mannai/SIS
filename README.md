### Architecture

This Project roughly follows MVVM Architecture where each screen has seperate file and each stateful screen is contained in a folder with 2 files 

1) View file (layout logic) 
2) View Model File (data processing and state management). 

This Project uses [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for State Management. 
[hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive), [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) for storage. 
[dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for making network requests.
